### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation, I performed the following tasks
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Data Analysis

Some interesting code/feature worked with:

To set a Target Goal, I used this DAX function
```dax
QTR1 = CALCULATE(SUM('Amazon Sale Report'[AMOUNT]),DATESBETWEEN('Amazon Sale Report'[DATE],DATE(2022,03,31),DATE(2022,05,14)))
```
```dax
QTR2 = CALCULATE(SUM('Amazon Sale Report'[AMOUNT]),DATESBETWEEN('Amazon Sale Report'[DATE],DATE(2022,05,15),DATE(2022,06,29)))
```
```dax
TARGET VALUE = CALCULATE([QTR1]*1.1)
```
for Cancellation Rate
```dax
ORDER CANCELLATION RATE = SUM('Amazon Sale Report'[CANCELLATION RATE])/ COUNT('Amazon Sale Report'[ORDER ID])
```
for Fulfilment Rate
```dax
ORDER FULFILMENT RATE = SUM('Amazon Sale Report'[FULFILLMENT RATE])/COUNT('Amazon Sale Report'[ORDER ID])
```
```dax
AVG ORDER = SUM('Amazon Sale Report'[AMOUNT])/COUNT('Amazon Sale Report'[ORDER ID])
```

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- Maharashtra is a leading state in turnover
- The T-shirt is a top-selling product
- Customers favour expedited shipping over standard shipping
- The turnover for the second quarter is 19.5% lower than that of the first quarter
- May 03 had the highest volume of orders placed

 ### Recommendations

- Watch is the lowest -selling item. To boost sales ,offer a "Watch Deal" promotion with 15% off
- Shoes and Socks are the lowest-selling items. To boost sales, offer a "Buy 3 Sets of Socks, Get 1 Set Off" promotion and introduce a "Back to School" promotion for shoes from May 10 to May 30 with 20% discount to drive purchases during this key period
- Cancellation rates are highest in Maharashtra, followed by Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu. Addressing specific issues in these states will help reduce cancellations
- Orders dropped from 880 to 410 between June 15 and June 29, and there was a similar decline from May 10 to May 26. Need to investigate the causes of these declines and implement corrective measures
- To boost sales in the lowest-performing areas, Pondicherry and Lakshadweep, deploy localized marketing strategies and targeted promotions, and streamline logistics for faster delivery and improved customer satisfaction
- Also give, 
  - "Wallet Wednesday": Run a weekly promotion offering gift voucher off all wallets on Wednesdays. This creates a regular buying habit and boosts mid-week sales
  - "Scent of the Season": Offer a 10% discount on perfumes and include a free sample of a new fragrance, encouraging customers to try new scents while buying their favorites.
  - Offer a 25% discount on Blazers during special periods such as the Diwali festive season or the end-of-winter sale. This attracts customers looking for high-value purchases at a lower price point, especially during these key shopping times.
  - Shirt & T-Shirt Deal: Offer 30% off when customers buy 4 shirts or 4 T-shirts, encouraging bulk purchases and boosting overall sales.
